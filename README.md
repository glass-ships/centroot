# CentROOT

A CentOS 7 Docker image including installations of Cern ROOT 6.14 and Anaconda 3.

This image can be used as a base environment into which you can install analysis packages that depend on ROOT. 

You can also build in an installation of JupyterLab and set it up to run through your local host. 
(This is black magic to me though, I recommend looking into [this repository](https://github.com/slaclab/slac-jupyterhub) as an example)
